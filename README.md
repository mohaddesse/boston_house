### Boston House Pricing Prediction
in this project first we have exploratary data analysis like check linearity, eliminate outliers, check normality,Homoscedasticity ....
then we test models:
1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Regressor
3. Ridge Regression
4. XGB Regressor
5. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Random Forest
and finally we compare R2 score rmse and cross validation to choose best model.

and for each models we check normality linearity Homoscedasticity ...
